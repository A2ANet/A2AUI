# Agent2Agent (A2A) UI

A UI for the [Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol](https://google-a2a.github.io/A2A/) made with [React](https://react.dev/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and [MUI](https://mui.com/).

The A2A protocol has standardised Agent2Agent communication by introducing concepts like: A2A Client, A2A Server, Agent Card, Message, Task, Part, Artifact, and [more](https://google-a2a.github.io/A2A/specification/#2-core-concepts-summary).
For example, an A2A Client is an application or agent that initiates requests to an A2A Server on behalf of a user or another system, and an Artifact is an output (e.g., a document, image, structured data) generated by the agent as a result of a task, composed of Parts.
By standardising Agent2Agent communication, the A2A Protocol can be used to standardise agent communication generally, including User2Agent.

## Features

This repository demonstrates how the A2A protocol can be used to standardise agent communication:

- Add an Agent from a URL and fetch its Agent Card
- Send messages with a TypeScript version of the [A2A SDK](https://github.com/google-a2a/a2a-python) A2A Client
- Keep track of chat sessions with Context
- Split units of work within a chat session into Tasks
- Render markdown supported Messages and Artifacts

## Use Cases

This repository is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, and can be used:

- For A2A Server development
- To allow other users to access your A2A Server or agent (by making it A2A compatible)
- To easily use existing A2A Servers

## Installation

To install:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/A2ANet/A2AUI.git`
2. Install the packages: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

## Usage

After starting the development server, click "+ Agent" to add an A2A compatible agent.
For an example, see [Tavily Agent](https://github.com/A2ANet/TavilyAgent).

- Each chat session (Context) is associated with a single agent.
- The A2A compatible agent must respond with `TaskStatusUpdateEvent` and `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent`s only, `Message`s by themselves are not currently supported.
- For best user experience, the A2A compatible agent should use the context ID to an entire chat session's chat history.

## Roadmap

- Add CI/CD
- Add tests
- Add "Contributing" section
- Refactor `useAgentManager` and `useContextManager`
- Add message streaming
- Migrate A2A SDK to server-side APIs
- Enable multi-agent conversations
- Add push notifications
